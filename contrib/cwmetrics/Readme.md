# CW Metrics (CloudWatch Metrics)
This makes many of the cloudwatch metrics available as a nice dashboard inside
of DOMjudge. It lets you watch things like the RDS disk space, DynamoDB read/write
requests, load balancer error numbers, etc.

Handy to look at during your contest as a sanity check that nothing is falling
apart or broken. Can also be used to see when you might need to scale things
up if you nice limits being reached.
